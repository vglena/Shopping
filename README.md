# üõí Shopping Behavior Prediction

This project implements a **machine learning classifier** to predict whether a user will make a purchase during an online shopping session based on session data.

---

## üìñ Overview

The project uses a dataset of user sessions (`shopping.csv`) with approximately 12,000 rows. Each row represents a user session with **17 features** describing user activity, browser, system, and session metrics, as well as the target label (`Revenue`) indicating whether the user made a purchase.

### Features

- **Administrative**: Number of administrative pages visited (int)  
- **Administrative_Duration**: Time spent on administrative pages (float)  
- **Informational**: Number of informational pages visited (int)  
- **Informational_Duration**: Time spent on informational pages (float)  
- **ProductRelated**: Number of product-related pages visited (int)  
- **ProductRelated_Duration**: Time spent on product-related pages (float)  
- **BounceRates**, **ExitRates**, **PageValues**: Metrics from Google Analytics (float)  
- **SpecialDay**: Proximity to a special day (float)  
- **Month**: Month of the session (int 0‚Äì11)  
- **OperatingSystems**, **Browser**, **Region**, **TrafficType**: User and system info (int)  
- **VisitorType**: 1 for returning visitors, 0 otherwise (int)  
- **Weekend**: 1 if session was on a weekend, 0 otherwise (int)  

**Label:** `Revenue` ‚Äì 1 if user made a purchase, 0 otherwise.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```python
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopping-predictor.git
cd shopping-predictor
```
2. Install dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the predictor:
```python
python shopping.py
```
The program will:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Split data into training and testing sets.
3. Train a 1-Nearest Neighbor (1-NN) classifier.
4. Evaluate the model using sensitivity and specificity metrics.

## üîß Dependencies / Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pandas ‚Äì for CSV data handling
- scikit-learn ‚Äì for K-Nearest Neighbor classifier
Example `requirements.txt`:
```python
pandas>=1.5.0
scikit-learn>=1.2.0
```
## üìà Evaluation Metrics
- Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):
  Proportion of actual buyers correctly predicted as buyers.
- Specificity (True Negative Rate):
  Proportion of non-buyers correctly predicted as non-buyers.

## üèÅ Credits
Educational purpose: Demonstrates data preprocessing, feature encoding, and KNN classifier usage for supervised machine learning tasks.
Dataset is synthetic and based on online shopping session behaviors.
